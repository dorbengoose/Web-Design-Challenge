                    <p> While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you.
                        <br> Staying true to your mission, you've since joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals.
                        <br> In their most recent efforts, they have since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
                        <br> As their Chief Data Analyst, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study.
                        <br> In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days.
                        <br> Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.</p>

                        <li>The first 20 dyas Zoniferol, Ceftamin and Naftisol have a disappointing response. However after 35 days at the end of the observation, they remain almost equal without dropping further.</li>
